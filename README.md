# 🧩 FoundersLink – Social Networking for Verified Business Owners

## 📱 Project Description

**FoundersLink** is an Android web application built to connect verified business owners through a clean, modern, and media-rich social networking experience. Inspired by Instagram’s visual design and Twitter’s post flexibility, FoundersLink is exclusively for real entrepreneurs who own legal entities like LLCs, S-Corps, C-Corps, or sole proprietorships.

Unlike general platforms filled with bots, spam, or non-serious users, FoundersLink verifies every user for legitimacy—ensuring high-value networking, trustworthy content, and true peer-to-peer connections among builders, founders, and freelancers.

## 📘 Project Outline

- **Problem Addressed:** Business owners don’t have a focused platform to find real peers, collaborators, or clients. Existing platforms are broad and cluttered.
- **Innovation:** FoundersLink applies Dr. Hyman’s principles of innovation by addressing a real-world gap using today's best tools (React, Firebase, and PWA tech).
- **Cloud Tools:** The app will leverage Firebase for user authentication, file storage (for images/videos), and real-time data. Tailwind CSS provides fast styling. React Router enables clean navigation.
- **Goal:** A scalable, secure, and visual-first platform for verified entrepreneurs to engage, promote, and connect.
